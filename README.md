# Modular JavaScript Project
what's the simpilest js we can make here?

`npm start`


http://localhost:8080



No, docker, no gulp/webpack, no node or servers or anything. 


So, a server is required when using `type='module'` since there's cors errors. The simpilest and easiest solution was to add http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
